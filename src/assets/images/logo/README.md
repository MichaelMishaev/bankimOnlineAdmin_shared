# Logo Assets

## ✅ Logo Successfully Integrated!

The logo has been successfully integrated into the SharedHeader component.

**Current logo files:** 
- `logo.png` (6.8KB) - Source file in src/assets
- `/public/assets/images/logo.png` - Production file served by Vite

## Integration Details

The logo is now:
- ✅ Served from public folder (`/assets/images/logo.png`)
- ✅ Properly sized (96x42.86px on desktop)
- ✅ Responsive (scales down on mobile devices)
- ✅ Clickable with navigation functionality
- ✅ Has hover effect (slight scale animation)
- ✅ Vite-compatible (no import issues)

## Responsive Sizes

- **Desktop**: 96px × 42.86px
- **Tablet (768px)**: 60px × 28px  
- **Mobile (480px)**: 50px × 24px

## Current Implementation

```tsx
// In SharedHeader.tsx
// Logo is served from public folder - no import needed

// Used as:
<img 
  src="/assets/images/logo.png" 
  alt="BankIM Logo" 
  className="logo-image"
  width="96"
  height="43"
/>
```

## File Locations

1. **Source file**: `src/assets/images/logo/logo.png` (for backup/source)
2. **Production file**: `public/assets/images/logo.png` (served by Vite)

## Why Public Folder?

The logo is placed in the public folder because:
- ✅ No Vite import resolution issues
- ✅ Better performance (direct static serving)
- ✅ More reliable across different Vite configurations
- ✅ Standard practice for static assets

## CSS Styling

```css
.logo-image {
  width: 96px;
  height: 42.86px;
  object-fit: contain;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: transform 0.2s ease;
}

.logo-image:hover {
  transform: scale(1.05);
}
```

The logo now appears perfectly in the dark header (#111928) as designed in the Figma specifications, with no Vite import issues.
